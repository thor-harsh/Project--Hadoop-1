# Project--Hadoop-1

<table>

  **In this project we use MapReduce which is a heart of hadoop and coded it using python to find the count the total ratings of each movie id.**

  MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster.
  As the processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop.
  The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform.<br>
  The first is the map job, which takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value pairs).<br></br>
